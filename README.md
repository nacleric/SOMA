# SDL OVERRIDES MAIN ANNOYINGLY

So you're telling me I need to download visual studio to use a c compiler. Than I need to find the location of a script to allow me to use the c compiler in the terminal? And every time I open my computer I need to run the script?

cl /EHsc ./src/main.cpp /I ./include /link ./lib/windows/SDL2.lib
